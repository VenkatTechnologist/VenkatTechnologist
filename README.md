Hi, I am Venkat Ramakrishnan. I am a Software Technologist and a consulting Chief Quality Officer.
I am interested in creating value for organisations by enhancing the quality of the software products
that they produce.

I am currently learning collobrating on Github, specifically with Github Actions, as automation can
streamline many of the errorprone, repetitive tasks, leading to faster and accurate results (provided
they are implemented correctly and thoroughly - which is a human oversight responsibility).

I'm looking for opportunities to collaborate on Github Actions, Software Security, Software Performance,
Python, Prolog, and generative AI projects.

You can reach me by sending a message at LinkedIn (https://linkedin.com/in/venkatramakrishnan),
or email me at venkat.technologist@gmail.com.

✨ Fun Fact ✨ Did you know that I am an author? You can find my short stories collection in Amazon
